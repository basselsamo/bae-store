## Stories Implemented in This Sprint

### Sprint 09

During Sprint 09, we aimed to implement user authentication using Passport.js, which involved following lessons 24 and 25 to understand the use of the Passport.js module. The plan was to implement a user story from our backlog that relies on user authentication, either by using the “local” strategy or an external authentication provider. However, we encountered significant technical obstacles that prevented us from reaching this sprint goal.

Despite our efforts, the authentication with Passport.js did not work correctly. As a result, we decided to focus on an alternative story from our backlog. We successfully implemented a feature allowing users to filter products based on criteria such as brand, year, gender, etc. This new feature enhances the user experience by enabling more efficient browsing and product discovery.

## Technical Issues and Resolutions

During this sprint, our primary technical issue was the unsuccessful integration of Passport.js for user authentication. We addressed this by pivoting to implement the product filtering feature, which was successfully integrated into the product listing page.

## Reflection

Sprint 09 presented significant challenges with the attempted integration of Passport.js for user authentication. Although we could not achieve this goal, we adapted by focusing on an alternative story that added value to our project. The product filtering feature now allows users to filter products based on various criteria, improving their shopping experience. This sprint underscored the importance of flexibility and having contingency plans in our development process. Moving forward, we aim to address the technical challenges with Passport.js in a future sprint while continuing to enhance the BAE-Store platform.
